	  <h2>About me</h2>
	  <p>Hello, welcome to my website.</p>
	  <p>I am Lili Tong, a Ph.D student from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.insa-lyon.fr/en">INSA Lyon</a>, laboratory <a target="_blank" href="https://liris.cnrs.fr/membres?idn=ltong">LIRIS</a>.
	  	My primary research interest is in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, which is focusing on exploring interaction, collaboration, and applications in multi-surface environments (imagine an environment that combines different devices, such as tabletops, wall displays, tablets, mobile phones, and also PCs). 
	  </p>
	  <p>As a Ph.D. student in Computer Science, I have the background of Electrical Engineering (M.S.) and Physics (B.S.). Studies in different domains made me have a quite open mind. I'm interested in different kinds of new technologies, especially the ones that can facilitate our daily lives.</p>
