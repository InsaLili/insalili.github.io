	  <h1>About me</h1>
	  <p>Hello, welcome to my website. I am Lili Tong, a PhD student from INSA-Lyon, France. My primary research interest is Human Computer Interaction, which is more focusing on exploring multi-devices interaction and application for learning. </p>
	  <p>Not as most of PhD students in Computer Science, I have a background in Electrical Engineering (MSc) and Physics (BSc). The undergraduate education in Physics made me have a better critical and logical thinking.</p>
