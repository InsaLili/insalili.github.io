	<p>I contacted with the area of human computer interaction(HCI) when I just started my PhD. Before that, I would rather take myself as an electronics engineer, as what I did in my master school was more dealing with hardware, and programming C codes directly into chips. HCI was a bran-new and attractive field to me. I started to think about how to take advantages of interactive surfaces, such as wall displays, tabletops, tablets and mobile phones, to facilitate our lives, especially for learning purpose.</p>
	<p>After digged in both literature and technical aspect, I developed two immature prototypes.</p>

				<h5>Description:</h5>
				<p>This is the first prototype I designed during my PhD study. It's an infrastructure which allows the dynamic reconfiguration of interactive spaces by grouping different devices together. I applied a simple web-based game onto this infrastructure. The game world could be automatially extended when we bring in new devices. User can touch the interactive surface to control a little player to jump through devices. To see how it works, please check the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/A-14eEVYPoM">video</a> here.</p>
