	<p>I have a wide range but not proficient interests. I like swimming, I go to swimming pool frequently, for both interest and health. I'm a kind of person who can't live without music. I can also play a little instruments, such as keyboard, bamboo flute and harmonica. After I started pursuing my PhD in France, I falled in love with cooking and travelling as they are two easy ways to cheer me up after a tough research day or period.</p>

			<p>I also have two very Chinese hobbies, table tennis and Chinese chess. I started to play table tennis when I was quite young, and just played for fun. In Jilin University there are table tennis competitions each year organized either by club or by university. To be honestly I'm not really good at it. Thanks to my good lucks and great teammates, my unskilled playing could always earn me some small awards. The photo on the left side was shot after a university competition in 2012. We represented our department won the second place.</p>
			<p>Playing Chinese chess is a tradition in my family, it's like a casual game to kill time. I learned it by watching my father played when I was a little girl. I attended the Chinese chess competition in my university in 2010, won the third place. Then I represented my university to attend the competition in Jilin province and won the first place of team and the fifth place of individual.</p>
