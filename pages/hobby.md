			<p>I have two main very Chinese hobbies, table tennis and Chinese chess. I played ping-pong when I was quite young, and just played for fun. When I stepped into university, there were ping-pong matches every year, organized either by clubs or by university. I realized that the "skill" I had for playing ping-pong could earn me some small awards. The photo on the right side was shot after we won the second prize</p>
			<p>I started to play Chniese chess also when I was quite young. My whole family could play Chniese chess, and my father is the best. I learned chess by watching him played. I attended the Chinese chess match in my university in 2010, won the third place. Then I represented my university to attend the match in Jilin province and won the fifth place.</p>
